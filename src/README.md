# JavaScript Group Capstone Project

> This is a JavaScript capstone project. It is a web application based on an external API. A selected API provides data about different recipes. The webapp has two interfaces. 1. A home page showing a list of items that you can "like." 2. A popup window with more data about an item that you can use to comment on the item.
